I hope this message finds you well. I'd like to highlight a critical issue in the ENBD login page that's affecting Liv users. When users return to the login screen from the DAO flow or after logging out, the Login and "Apply for an Account" buttons become invisible. Users are forced to exit the application to proceed.

Please refer to the attached screenshot for clarity.

This issue is causing significant user inconvenience. I kindly request your prompt attention to address and resolve this matter urgently.

Thank you for your swift action on this.

Best regards,


The problem arises when users navigate back to the login screen from the DAO flow or after logging out. In this scenario, the Login button and the "Apply for an Account" buttons are not visible. Users are unable to proceed with logging in again or continuing with the DAO flow without exiting the application.
